## Project Description
We will create 2048 game for final project. First, we will design an interface featuring a game board with a matrix to hold the numbers. Then, we will design a controller to manage player movements(right, left, up, down). The game is played on a 4x4 board, and the goal is to achieve the number 2048 by combining tiles that are multiples of 2
